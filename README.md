# Overview

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software's performance and behavior.

If you are not familiar with the OpenTelemetry project, I strongly recommend you thoroughtly read the official documentation on the <https://opentelemetry.io/> to get a deep understanding of underlain concepts.

This repository is focused on metrics only and contains an example of a service instrumented with some useful metrics as well as a bunch of custom metrics. It can be used as a quick start with the OpenTelemetry.
